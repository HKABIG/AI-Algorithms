# AI Algorithms

Welcome to the AI Algorithms repository! This collection of algorithms is part of my college syllabus at VIT Pune, encompassing basic implementations of fundamental Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

## Introduction

These algorithms serve as educational implementations for learning and understanding various Artificial Intelligence concepts. They are designed to align with the curriculum at VIT Pune and cover a range of essential AI algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

1. **8-Puzzle Solver**: A simple implementation of the A* algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

2. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**: Implementation of a hill climbing algorithm for optimization problems.

3. **Fuzzy Set Calculator**: A program that calculates fuzzy set membership values based on sensitivity parameters.

4. **Refrigerator System Logic**: Logic for simulating a refrigerator system, including temperature control and item placement.

5. **Perceptron Learning Algorithm**: Implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm for a basic neural network.

## Scope for Improvement

These implementations have ample room for improvement and optimization. Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Your contributions will be reviewed and appreciated.
